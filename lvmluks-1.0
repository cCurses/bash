# What is this?
#
# lvmluks is a bash script that tries to automate the process of setting up lvm inside a luks encrypted device.
# It will create two partitions on your drive. One for /boot and One that holds the LVM volumes.
# It will ask you for your preferences in terms of volumegroup names and sizes along the way.
